In-Active,1,This product is generated making use of Backscatter data at composite slice level as available in L2A product of OSCAT and L2B wind vector product from OSCAT presently at 50km wind vector cells. Wind directions at composite slice location are interpolated utilizing neighbouring cells while wind speed is recalculated using backscattering coefficient and the OSCAT specific GMF. The quality flag of L2B product is reproduced.,2014-01-05,Orbitwise,38, - ,O2-SCT-HWV,O2SCT,4,P,2011-12-23,"L04_HVW.gif,L04_HWV.gif",10.19038/SAC/10/O2-SCT-HWV
